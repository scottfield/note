#Creational Pattern

##Factory Method 
provides a simple decision making class that returns one of several possible subclasses of 
an abstract base class depending on the data that are provided.
##Abstract Factory Method 
provides an interface to create and return one of several families of related objects.
##Builder Pattern 
separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that several 
different representations can be created depending on the needs of the program.
##Prototype Pattern 
starts with an initialized and instantiated
class and copies or clones it to make new instances rather than creating new
instances.
##Singleton Pattern 
is a class of which there can be no more than
one instance. It provides a single global point of access to that instance.

#Structural Pattern

##Adapter Pattern
 used to change the interface of one class to that of another one.
##Bridge Pattern
intended to keep the interface to your client program
constant while allowing you to change the actual kind of class you
display or use. You can then change the interface and the underlying class
separately.
##Composite Pattern
a collection of objects, any one of which may be either itself a Composite, or just a primitive object.
##The Decorator Pattern
a class that surrounds a given class, adds new capabilities to it, and passes all the unchanged methods
to the underlying class.
##Facade Pattern
which groups a complex object hierarchy and provides a new, simpler interface to access those data.
##Flyweight Pattern
which provides a way to limit the proliferation of small, similar class instances by moving some of the class data outside
the class and passing it in during various execution methods.
##Proxy Pattern
which provides a simple place-holder class for a more complex class which is expensive to instantiate.

#Behavioral Pattern

##Observer Pattern 
defines the way a number of classes can be notified of a change
##Mediator Pattern 
defines how communication between classes can be simplified by using another class to keep all classes
from having to know about each other.
##Chain of Responsibility Pattern 
allows an even further decoupling between classes, by passing a request between classes until it is recognized.
##Template Pattern 
provides an abstract definition of an algorithm
##Interpreter Pattern
provides a definition of how to include language elements in a program.
##Strategy Pattern 
encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
##Visitor Pattern 
adds function to a class
##State Pattern 
provides a memory for a classâ€™s instance variables.
##Command Pattern 
provides a simple way to separate execution of a command from the interface environment that produced it
##Iterator Pattern 
formalizes the way we move through a list of data within a class.
