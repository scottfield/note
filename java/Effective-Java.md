- Prefer Static factory method to Constructor

  advantages:
    - One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike
      constructors, they have names.
    - A second advantage of static factory methods is that,
      unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new
      object each time theyâ€™re invoked.
    - A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike
      constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of
      their return type.
    - A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of
     the returned object can vary from call to call as a function
     of the input parameters.
    - A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the
      returned object need not exist when the class containing
      the method is written.
  
  drawbacks:
    - The main limitation of providing only static factory
      methods is that classes without public or protected
      constructors cannot be subclassed
     - A second shortcoming of static factory methods is that
       they are hard for programmers to find.
